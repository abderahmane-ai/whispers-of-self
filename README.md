## 🎯 Overview

**Whispers of Self** is a sophisticated agent-based modeling (ABM) research platform that investigates how individual strategies, resource scarcity, and adaptive learning shape population-level outcomes in simulated environments. Our platform explores emergent cooperation, collapse dynamics, and oscillatory patterns under various constraints.

### 🌟 What Makes It Special

- **🧠 Multi-Strategy Agents**: Altruists, Pragmatists, and Egoists with distinct behavioral patterns
- **⚡ Adaptive Learning**: Rule-based, cultural, evolutionary, and reinforcement learning modes
- **🌍 Real-World Applications**: Fisheries management, urban commons, bandwidth allocation
- **📈 Comprehensive Analytics**: Extinction probability, inequality metrics, sustainability analysis

## ✨ Features

### 🎮 Core Simulation Engine
- **Agent-Based Model**: Sophisticated population simulation with distinct personality types
- **Resource Dynamics**: Regenerating main pools + intermittent high-value resources
- **Environmental Shocks**: Stochastic events testing system resilience
- **Network Topologies**: Flexible pairing mechanisms for resource negotiation

### 🧬 Adaptation Mechanisms
- **Rule-Based**: Baseline deterministic strategies
- **Cultural Learning**: Social transmission of successful behaviors
- **Evolutionary Selection**: Natural selection pressure on strategies
- **Reinforcement Learning**: PPO/DQN for adaptive agent behavior

### 📊 Analysis & Visualization

- **Real-time Metrics**: Population dynamics, resource levels, cooperation rates
- **Static Plots**: Matplotlib/Seaborn for publication-ready figures
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Streamlit/Dash for exploratory analysis *(planned)*

### 🔬 Research Tools
- **Reproducibility**: YAML configurations, seed-based determinism
- **Docker Support**: Containerized environments for consistent results
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed CSV outputs for post-analysis
- **Unit Testing**: Robust test suite for validation
